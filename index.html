			<h2>Subtheme: Corporate Landlords &amp; Evictions</h2>

			<h3>Dataset</h3>
			<p>
				The dataset I chose tracks two key property ownership metrics (corporate ownership rate and owner occupancy rate) across 21 Boston neighborhoods from 2004 to 2024. The ownership rates are derived from the City of Boston’s annual property assessment records; note: corporate ownership is identified through keyphrase matching on owner names (flagging entities with markers like “LLC,” “LP,” “Realty,” “Trust,” etc.), while owner occupancy is drawn from a direct <code>OWN_OCC</code> field in the assessment data. We should note that the corporate ownership classification introduces some fuzziness, as not all corporate-owned properties may be captured, and some non-corporate entities may occasionally be misidentified. The dataset also includes a static snapshot of 2020 U.S. Census demographic data for each neighborhood (population totals, racial and ethnic breakdowns, housing unit counts, and group quarters populations), joined to every year row. Because the Census fields do not vary across years, they reflect neighborhood demographics at a single point in time instead of tracking change alongside the ownership rates. I’m interested in this dataset in particular because I thought it'd be interesting to see the 20-year longitudinal window of how the structure of property ownership in Boston has shifted and how that shift maps onto neighborhoods with different racial and economic compositions, as someone who has lived in Boston for most of my life.
			</p>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>I want to know if there is a structural tradeoff between corporate ownership and owner occupancy and how strong it is across Boston’s neighborhoods.</strong><br>
					 Motivation: The Homes for All MA report argues that live-in landlords file fewer evictions, which seems to imply that owner-occupancy is a stabilizing force. If corporate ownership and owner occupancy are really inverse forces, we should see a strong negative correlation between them across neighborhoods. So I want to ask this as a foundational check before drawing conclusions for policy recommendation about promoting local ownership.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Has corporate ownership grown faster in majority-white or majority-nonwhite neighborhoods? What does that suggest about who bears the risk of displacement?</strong><br>
					 Motivation: The Homes for All MA report found that communities of color, specifically Black and Latino residents, faced disproportionately high eviction rates. If corporate ownership has been growing fastest in neighborhoods with more people of color living there, then that would point to a compounding dynamic between financialization and racial displacement. I want to use the 2004–2024 window to test whether Boston fits this national pattern.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Did the COVID-19 pandemic accelerate the pace of corporate acquisition and which neighborhoods saw the sharpest post-pandemic inflection?</strong><br>
					 Motivation: The Homes for All MA report documents that corporate landlords continued filing evictions even during the moratorium. A related question is whether the pandemic also accelerated corporate entry into the housing market, which is consistent with national reporting on institutional investors exploiting pandemic-era disruption.

			<h2>Discoveries &amp; Insights</h2>

			<h3>Data Overview &amp; Quality</h3>

			<p>
				The dataset contains 441 records across 21 Boston neighborhoods, covering 2004–2024 (21 years × 21 neighborhoods). The two time-varying fields that are central to my analysis are <code>corp_own_rate</code> and <code>own_occ_rate</code>. All demographic variables are static across years.  This is because they reflect a single Census snapshot joined to every year row. This means we unfortunately can't track how neighborhood demographics changed over the same 20-year window, only how ownership rates changed against a fixed demographic baseline. In terms of data quality, these were the points:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Census-derived fields are identical for every year within a neighborhood. Any demographic analysis here reflects the structure of the join, not real change over time.</li>
				<li>No missing values were found in any of the 441 records across all 40 fields.</li>
				<li> All 21 neighborhoods in Boston have exactly 21 records, one per year, so there's no gaps.</li>
				<li>I calculated vacancy rates using vacant_unit / tot_unit. Those values appear plausible (4–22%), with South Boston Waterfront and Downtown showing higher vacancy in 2024. I think this may reflect new luxury construction with slow absorption.</li>
			</ul>

				<figcaption>
					
					Corporate ownership rates seem to range from about 10% to 41%, right-skewed with most neighborhoods below 30%. Owner occupancy seems to be more symmetric, centered around 35–45%. Vacancy rates are low and concentrated, with a few outliers above 15%. These distributions confirm that corporate expansion is not uniform. Rather, it varies substantially across neighborhoods, making neighborhood-level disaggregation essential.

				<img src="figs/fig4_gutcheck_2020 (1).png">

					<strong></strong>
					I wanted to do this as a sort of sanity check. Like we would expect outer residential neighborhoods like West Roxbury, Hyde Park, and Roslindale to have the highest owner occupancy, and denser rental-heavy neighborhoods like Fenway, Allston, and Longwood to have the lowest. This snapshot of 2024 confirms this. West Roxbury leads at 66% owner occupancy and 7% corporate ownership, while Fenway sits at 16% owner occupancy and 27% corporate ownership. I feel that this is close enough alignment with expectations to build confidence in the dataset’s validity.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/fig3_citywide_trend.png">
				<figcaption>
					<strong></strong>
					Averaged across all of the 21 neighborhoods, corporate ownership rose from about 5.5% in 2004 to 25.3% in 2024, a roughly 5x increase. Over the same period, average owner occupancy declined from 43.6% to 38.0%. The two trends move in opposite directions throughout, and the gap appears to widen after COVID-19 (I marked this with dotted line), foreshadowing some of the results from my analysis of the questions I had.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>Question 1: The Structural Tradeoff Between Corporate &amp; Owner Occupancy</h3>

			<p>From what I've read, the central premise of housing stability research is that corporate landlords and owner-occupants represent opposite ends of the landlord spectrum. Here, I tested some ways to show whether this tradeoff appears structurally across Boston’s neighborhoods.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/fig5_q1_scatter.png">
				<figcaption>
					
					I wanted to map the relationship between corporate ownership and owner occupance here. The relationship is quite strongly inverse. Specifically, I calculated the Pearson correlation between corporate ownership and owner occupancy across all 21 neighborhoods in 2020 to be −0.88. Meaning, neighborhoods with more corporate landlords have systematically fewer owner-occupants. The color encoding adds a secondary pattern which I thought could be interesting, race based trends. But evidently, the racial pattern in this scatter is actually pretty weak. Looking at the plot, it's not like the red dots (majority non-white) cluster cleanly in one corner and the green dots (majority white) in another. So perhaps this isn't an important factor here.

				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/fig6_q1_corr_time.png">
				<figcaption>
					
					I wanted to examine the correlation in figure 4 a bit more, so I decided to graph the correlation over time. The negative correlation between these two rates has remained consistently strong across the full 20-year window, hovering between −0.80 and −0.94 throughout. This stability suggests the tradeoff between corporate ownership and owner occupancy is a structural feature of Boston's housing market, not a recent phenomenon. The slight overall trend toward a stronger correlation, from −0.80 in 2004 to −0.88 in 2024, indicates the divide between corporate-heavy and owner-occupied neighborhoods has just slightly deepened over time. The COVID-19 onset (2020) doesn't visibly affect the trend.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>Question 2: Who Bears the Burden of Corporate Expansion?</h3>

			<p>Now that we've established the structural tradeoff, the next question I want to examine is if corporate expansion has been spatially equitable or if it has concentrated in neighborhoods where residents of color are most present. We didn't see much of a trend in figure 4, but I was wondering if alternative analyses may reveal something different.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/fig7_q2_lines.png">
				<figcaption>
					
I used a line chart to see whether any race-related trend in corporate ownership emerged over time. Every neighborhood saw corporate ownership rise, but growth was far from uniform. Perhaps counter-intuitively, the neighborhoods with the steepest absolute increases (South Boston Waterfront, Fenway, Charlestown) aren't the most non-white (shown in green/yellow on the color scale). Meanwhile, the most heavily non-white neighborhoods like Roxbury, Mattapan, and Dorchester started at slightly lower baselines and saw more moderate absolute growth. This might suggest that corporate investment has followed gentrification pressure rather than pre-existing minority concentration, though that interpretation is just my speculation. I do want to note that because  the demographic data is held constant at the 2020 Census snapshot, we can't observe how neighborhood racial composition itself shifted over this period. Given the well-documented gentrification Boston has experienced since 2004, this is a meaningful limitation; neighborhoods that appear majority non-white in the Census may look quite different at the start or end of our window, which makes any race-based interpretation of these trends difficult to draw with confidence.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/fig8_q2_change.png">
				<figcaption>
					
This representation shows a somewhat stronger racial trend than the line chart, which illustrates how choice of representation can surface different patterns in the same underlying data. South Boston Waterfront (+32 pp), Fenway (+27 pp), and East Boston (+27 pp) top the list. East Boston stands out as the only majority-nonwhite neighborhood (63% non-white, predominantly Latino) in the top tier of corporate growth, meaning it may face higher displacement risk than other nonwhite neighborhoods like Roxbury and Mattapan, where corporate growth has been slower. The overall correlation between corporate growth and % non-white is −0.52, suggesting corporate investment has so far preferred whiter, gentrifying neighborhoods, which could mean that majority-nonwhite areas face comparatively lower displacement risk from this mechanism at this moment in time. However, this could shift as those markets become saturated and capital seeks lower-cost entry points elsewhere. As with the previous figure, this interpretation is limited by the frozen 2020 demographics (neighborhoods that appear majority non-white in the Census may have looked quite different at the start of the period).				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/fig12_q2_deepdive.png">
				<figcaption>
					
					I just wanted to zoom in on some majority-nonwhite neighborhoods (left) vs. some majority-white or mixed neighborhoods (right) and see their trajectory shapes in particular (since isolating them makes it easier). Roxbury, Mattapan, Dorchester, and East Boston show steady, consistent growth throughout the period. In contrast, Charlestown and South Boston Waterfront show a pretty visible post-2020 inflection with steeper acceleration after COVID. This suggests potentially different mechanisms, with long-run structural corporate interest in nonwhite neighborhoods vs. a more recent speculative wave in gentrifying areas.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>Question 3: Did COVID-19 Accelerate Corporate Acquisition?</h3>

			<p>To fruther test whether COVID accelerated corporate entry, I fit linear trends to each neighborhood’s corporate ownership rate separately for the pre-COVID (2004–2019) and post-COVID (2020–2024) periods and compared the slopes.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/fig9_q3_slopes.png">
				<figcaption>
					
Every neighborhood in Boston except Roxbury experienced a higher rate of corporate acquisition after 2020 than before. Roxbury is a notable exception since its pre-COVID growth rate (0.83 pp/year) was actually the highest of any neighborhood before the pandemic, but its post-COVID rate (0.80 pp/year) barely changed, even decreasing, leaving it as the one neighborhood that did not accelerate. Post-COVID slopes in Charlestown, Longwood, and East Boston exceed 2.5 percentage points per year. This near-universal acceleration seems consistent with national reporting on institutional investors exploiting pandemic-era disruption to consolidate property holdings. It would be interesting to find more data on demographics to properly disentangle if these patterns reflect race, class, geography, or some combination of all three.				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/fig10_q3_occ_slopes.png" alt="Grouped bar chart comparing pre- and post-COVID annual change in owner occupancy rate by neighborhood">
				<figcaption>
					
Before COVID, nearly all neighborhoods were already losing owner occupancy at varying rates. After 2020, the picture is more mixed: several neighborhoods like Longwood, Downtown, South End, South Boston continue declining, while others like South Boston Waterfront, Roxbury, and East Boston show a slight post-COVID uptick in owner occupancy. We can note that the neighborhoods with the steepest pre-COVID declines (West End, Brighton, North End) have largely stabilized post-COVID, suggesting the pre-pandemic trend was not simply accelerated. Overall, post-COVID owner occupancy trends are more heterogeneous than the near-universal corporate ownership acceleration seen in the previous figure.				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="figs/fig11_q3_scatter.png">
				<figcaption>
					
					Plotting the post-COVID corporate ownership growth rate against each neighborhood’s % non-white residents shows a slightly negative relationship where whiter neighborhoods experienced faster corporate acquisition after 2020. East Boston is a clear outlier, majority Latino yet one of the highest post-COVID growth rates (I think reflecting its ongoing gentrification). Roxbury and Mattapan, both over 85% non-white, sit at the bottom of the post-COVID growth chart. I think this may reflect lower property values as a temporary barrier rather than protection from eventual corporate interest.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>
So I think our analysis reveals three core things. First, corporate ownership and owner occupancy are in near-perfect structural opposition, where the cross-neighborhood correlation has remained consistently strong from −0.80 in 2004 to −0.88 in 2024, confirming the mechanistic premise behind policies that promote local ownership as a tenant-stability strategy.
			</p>
			<p>
Second, the geography of corporate expansion doesn't simply track racial composition. The neighborhoods with the largest absolute corporate growth over 2004 to 2024 (South Boston Waterfront, Fenway, Charlestown) skew whiter and are in active gentrification. The most non-white neighborhoods (Roxbury, Mattapan, Hyde Park) have seen corporate ownership roughly triple but from lower baselines, suggesting comparatively lower displacement risk from this mechanism at this moment in time. East Boston is the most important exception, with a majority-Latino neighborhood with rapid corporate acquisition, making it a high-displacement-risk case to watch.
			</p>
			<p>
Third, COVID-19 was pretty much a near-universal accelerant. Nearly all neighborhoods saw a higher rate of corporate acquisition in 2020 to 2024 than before, with Roxbury as the one exception (its post-COVID growth rate of 0.80 pp/year barely changed from its pre-COVID rate of 0.83 pp/year). The window for policy intervention, before corporate ownership reaches levels that structurally foreclose owner-occupancy, appears to be narrowing rapidly, especially in mid-range neighborhoods like East Boston, Brighton, and Jamaica Plain.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Key limitation:</strong> As we discussed throught, demographic fields were frozen in this dataset at a single Census snapshot, so we can't observe how racial composition changed alongside ownership structure. Future work linking these trends to eviction filing data would definitely substantially strengthen the causal story.
