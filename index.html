    <h2>Corporate Landlords Are Reshaping Boston — Unevenly</h2>
    <div class="subtitle">Exploratory analysis of corporate ownership and owner occupancy across 21 Boston neighborhoods, 2004–2024.</div>
  </div>

  <!-- ── OVERALL QUESTIONS ── -->
  <h3>Overall Questions</h3>

  <p>Before looking at the data, I read through the <em>Homes for All MA</em> report on COVID-era evictions and the New York Times article on 83 million eviction records. Both emphasize that who owns a property — corporate entity vs. resident landlord — shapes how tenants are treated, especially in crises. With that framing, I posed three questions targeting different angles of the dataset.</p>

  <div class="question">
    <strong>Question 1</strong>
    Is there a structural tradeoff between corporate ownership and owner occupancy — and how strong is it across Boston's neighborhoods?
  </div>
  <p><em>Motivation:</em> The Homes for All MA report argues that live-in landlords file fewer evictions, implying owner-occupancy is a stabilizing force. If corporate ownership and owner occupancy are truly inverse forces, we should see a strong negative correlation between them across neighborhoods. This is the foundational check before any policy recommendation about promoting local ownership.</p>

  <div class="question">
    <strong>Question 2</strong>
    Has corporate ownership grown faster in majority-white or majority-nonwhite neighborhoods — and what does this suggest about who bears the risk of displacement?
  </div>
  <p><em>Motivation:</em> The Homes for All MA report found that communities of color — particularly Black and Latinx residents — faced disproportionately high eviction rates. If corporate ownership has been growing fastest in neighborhoods with more residents of color, that would point to a compounding dynamic between financialization and racial displacement. I use the 2004–2024 window to test whether Boston fits this national pattern.</p>

  <div class="question">
    <strong>Question 3</strong>
    Did the COVID-19 pandemic accelerate the pace of corporate acquisition — and which neighborhoods saw the sharpest post-pandemic inflection?
  </div>
  <p><em>Motivation:</em> The Homes for All MA report documents that corporate landlords continued filing evictions even during the moratorium. A related question is whether the pandemic also accelerated corporate entry into the housing market — consistent with national reporting on institutional investors exploiting pandemic-era disruption.</p>

  <!-- ── PHASE 1 ── -->
  <h3>Phase 1: Data Overview &amp; Quality</h3>

  <p>The dataset contains 441 records across 21 Boston neighborhoods, covering 2004–2024 (21 years × 21 neighborhoods). The two core time-varying fields are <code>corp_own_rate</code> and <code>own_occ_rate</code>. All demographic variables are <strong>static across years</strong> — they reflect a single Census snapshot joined to every year row. This means we cannot track how neighborhood demographics changed over the same 20-year window, only how ownership rates changed against a fixed demographic baseline.</p>

  <div class="dq-box">
    <p><strong>Data quality notes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frozen demographics:</strong> Census-derived fields (population, race counts, housing units) are identical for every year within a neighborhood. Any demographic analysis here reflects the structure of the join, not real change over time.</li>
      <li><strong>No missing values</strong> were found in any of the 441 records across all 40 fields.</li>
      <li><strong>All 21 neighborhoods have exactly 21 records</strong> — one per year — confirming a balanced panel with no gaps.</li>
      <li><strong>Vacancy rates</strong> (vacant_unit / tot_unit) appear plausible (4–22%), with South Boston Waterfront and Downtown showing higher vacancy in 2024, likely reflecting new luxury construction with slow absorption.</li>
    </ul>

      <strong>Figure 1 – Data Coverage: Records per Neighborhood</strong>
      Every neighborhood has exactly 21 records — one per year — confirming a perfectly balanced panel. The red dashed line marks the expected count of 21. This means there is no attrition or selective reporting that could bias trend analysis.

      <strong>Figure 2 – Distribution of Key Rates Across Neighborhoods (2024)</strong>
      Corporate ownership rates range from roughly 10% to 41%, right-skewed with most neighborhoods below 30%. Owner occupancy is more symmetric, centered around 35–45%. Vacancy rates are low and concentrated, with a few outliers above 15%. These distributions confirm that corporate expansion is not uniform — it varies substantially across neighborhoods, making neighborhood-level disaggregation essential.

    <figcaption>
      <strong>Figure 3 – Gut Check: Owner Occupancy vs. Corporate Ownership by Neighborhood (2020)</strong>
      As a sanity check, we expect outer residential neighborhoods like West Roxbury, Hyde Park, and Roslindale to have the highest owner occupancy, and denser rental-heavy neighborhoods like Fenway, Allston, and Longwood to have the lowest. The 2020 snapshot confirms this exactly: West Roxbury leads at 66% owner occupancy and 7% corporate ownership, while Fenway sits at 16% owner occupancy and 27% corporate ownership. This alignment with expectations builds confidence in the dataset's validity.

    <figcaption>
      <strong>Figure 4 – Citywide Trends: Corporate Ownership vs. Owner Occupancy (2004–2024)</strong>
      Averaged across all 21 neighborhoods, corporate ownership rose from 5.5% in 2004 to 25.3% in 2024 — a roughly 5× increase. Over the same period, average owner occupancy declined from 43.6% to 38.0%. The two trends move in opposite directions throughout, and the gap appears to widen after COVID-19 (marked with dotted line), which foreshadows the questions explored in Phase 2.

  <!-- ── Q1 ── -->
  <h3>Question 1: The Structural Tradeoff Between Corporate &amp; Owner Occupancy</h3>

  <p>The central premise of housing stability research is that corporate landlords and owner-occupants represent opposite ends of the landlord spectrum. I tested whether this tradeoff appears structurally across Boston's neighborhoods.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="figs/fig5_q1_scatter.png" alt="Corporate ownership vs owner occupancy, 2020, colored by % non-white">
    <figcaption>
      <strong>Figure 5 – Corporate Ownership vs. Owner Occupancy by Neighborhood (2020), colored by % non-white population</strong>
      The relationship is strikingly inverse: the Pearson correlation between corporate ownership and owner occupancy across all 21 neighborhoods in 2020 is −0.91. Neighborhoods with more corporate landlords have systematically fewer owner-occupants. The color encoding adds a secondary pattern: neighborhoods with the lowest owner occupancy and highest corporate ownership tend to have higher shares of non-white residents (darker red), while West Roxbury anchors the opposite end — high occupancy, low corporate ownership, majority white.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <img src="figs/fig6_q1_corr_time.png" alt="Correlation between corporate and owner occupancy over time, 2004–2024">
    <figcaption>
      <strong>Figure 6 – The Corporate–Owner Occupancy Correlation Has Deepened Over Time (2004–2024)</strong>
      Rather than a static relationship, the negative correlation between these two rates has strengthened over the full 20-year window, going from −0.80 in 2004 to −0.94 by 2023. This means that corporate-heavy neighborhoods are becoming more so, while owner-occupied neighborhoods are holding their character or losing ground more slowly. The COVID-19 onset (2020) does not visibly break the trend — the structural divergence was already well underway.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <!-- ── Q2 ── -->
  <h3>Question 2: Who Bears the Burden of Corporate Expansion?</h3>

  <p>Having established the structural tradeoff, the next question is whether corporate expansion has been spatially equitable — or whether it has concentrated in neighborhoods where residents of color are most present.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="figs/fig7_q2_lines.png" alt="Corporate ownership trends by neighborhood, colored by % non-white">
    <figcaption>
      <strong>Figure 7 – Corporate Ownership Trends by Neighborhood (2004–2024), colored by % non-white population</strong>
      Every neighborhood saw corporate ownership rise, but growth was far from uniform. Counter-intuitively, the neighborhoods with the steepest absolute increases — South Boston Waterfront, Fenway, Charlestown — are not the most non-white (shown in green/yellow on the color scale). Meanwhile, the most heavily non-white neighborhoods like Roxbury, Mattapan, and Dorchester started at lower baselines and saw more moderate absolute growth. This suggests corporate investment is currently tracking gentrification pressure more than pre-existing minority concentration.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <img src="figs/fig8_q2_change.png" alt="Change in corporate ownership 2004–2024, colored by % non-white">
    <figcaption>
      <strong>Figure 8 – Growth in Corporate Ownership 2004–2024 by Neighborhood, colored by % non-white population</strong>
      South Boston Waterfront (+32 pp), Fenway (+27 pp), and East Boston (+27 pp) top the list. East Boston stands out: it is the only majority-nonwhite neighborhood (63% non-white, predominantly Latinx) in the top tier of corporate growth, raising particular concerns about displacement risk. The overall correlation between corporate growth and % non-white is −0.52, suggesting corporate investment currently prefers whiter, gentrifying neighborhoods — but this may shift as those markets become saturated and capital seeks lower-cost entry points in majority-nonwhite areas.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

    <img src="figs/fig12_q2_deepdive.png" alt="Corporate ownership deep dives in selected neighborhoods">
    <figcaption>
      <strong>Figure 9 – Deep Dive: Corporate Ownership in Selected Neighborhoods, by Racial Composition</strong>
      Comparing four majority-nonwhite neighborhoods (left) vs. four majority-white or mixed neighborhoods (right) reveals different trajectory shapes. Roxbury, Mattapan, Dorchester, and East Boston show steady, consistent growth throughout the period. In contrast, Charlestown and South Boston Waterfront show a visible post-2020 inflection with steeper acceleration after COVID. This suggests different mechanisms: long-run structural corporate interest in nonwhite neighborhoods vs. a more recent speculative wave in gentrifying areas.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <!-- ── Q3 ── -->
  <h3>Question 3: Did COVID-19 Accelerate Corporate Acquisition?</h3>

  <p>To test whether COVID accelerated corporate entry, I fit linear trends to each neighborhood's corporate ownership rate separately for the pre-COVID (2004–2019) and post-COVID (2020–2024) periods and compared the slopes.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="figs/fig9_q3_slopes.png" alt="Pre vs post-COVID slopes of corporate ownership by neighborhood">
    <figcaption>
      <strong>Figure 10 – Rate of Corporate Ownership Growth Before vs. After COVID (annual slope, pp/year)</strong>
      Every single neighborhood in Boston experienced a higher rate of corporate acquisition after 2020 than before — without exception. Post-COVID slopes in Charlestown, Longwood, and East Boston exceed 2.5 percentage points per year. Even the slowest post-COVID growers (Roxbury, Hyde Park) outpaced their pre-pandemic rate. This universal acceleration is consistent with national reporting on institutional investors exploiting pandemic-era disruption to consolidate property holdings.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <img src="figs/fig10_q3_occ_slopes.png" alt="Pre vs post-COVID slopes of owner occupancy by neighborhood">
    <figcaption>
      <strong>Figure 11 – Rate of Owner Occupancy Change Before vs. After COVID (annual slope, pp/year)</strong>
      Before COVID, nearly all neighborhoods were already losing owner occupancy at a slow, steady rate. After 2020, the picture is more mixed: many neighborhoods have stabilized near zero slope, but several — Longwood, Downtown, South End — continue declining. Crucially, no neighborhood shows a meaningful post-COVID recovery in owner occupancy. Once owner-occupants leave, they are not returning. This data does not support a "temporary displacement" narrative.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <img src="figs/fig11_q3_scatter.png" alt="Post-COVID corporate growth rate vs % non-white population">
    <figcaption>
      <strong>Figure 12 – Post-COVID Corporate Growth Rate vs. Neighborhood Racial Composition</strong>
      Plotting post-COVID corporate ownership growth rate against each neighborhood's % non-white residents shows a negative relationship: whiter neighborhoods experienced faster corporate acquisition after 2020. East Boston is a clear outlier — majority Latinx yet one of the highest post-COVID growth rates, reflecting its ongoing gentrification. Roxbury and Mattapan, both over 85% non-white, sit at the bottom of the post-COVID growth chart. This may reflect lower property values as a temporary barrier rather than protection from eventual corporate interest.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <!-- ── SUMMARY ── -->
  <div class="summary">
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p><strong>Three core findings emerge from this analysis.</strong> First, corporate ownership and owner occupancy are in near-perfect structural opposition: the cross-neighborhood correlation has grown from −0.80 in 2004 to −0.94 in 2023, confirming the mechanistic premise behind policies that promote local ownership as a tenant-stability strategy.</p>
    <p>Second, the geography of corporate expansion does not simply track racial composition. The neighborhoods with the largest absolute corporate growth over 2004–2024 — South Boston Waterfront, Fenway, Charlestown — skew whiter and are in active gentrification. The most non-white neighborhoods (Roxbury, Mattapan, Hyde Park) have seen corporate ownership roughly triple but from lower baselines. East Boston is the most important exception: a majority-Latinx neighborhood with rapid corporate acquisition, making it a high-displacement-risk case to watch.</p>
    <p>Third, COVID-19 was a universal accelerant. Without exception, every neighborhood saw a higher rate of corporate acquisition in 2020–2024 than in any comparable pre-pandemic window. The window for policy intervention — before corporate ownership reaches levels that structurally foreclose owner-occupancy — appears to be narrowing rapidly, especially in mid-range neighborhoods like East Boston, Brighton, and Jamaica Plain.</p>
    <p><strong>Key limitation:</strong> Demographic fields are frozen at a single Census snapshot, so we cannot observe how racial composition changed alongside ownership structure. Future work linking these trends to eviction filing data would substantially strengthen the causal story.</p>
